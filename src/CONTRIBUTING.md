Contributing to Anno-Mage
============================

How to contribute
-----------------

The preferred workflow for contributing to Anno-Mage is to fork the
[main repository](https://github.com/virajmavani/semi-auto-image-annotation-tool) on
GitHub, clone, and develop on a branch. Steps:

1. Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/virajmavani/semi-auto-image-annotation-tool)
   by clicking on the 'Fork' button near the top right of the page. This creates
   a copy of the code under your GitHub user account. For more details on
   how to fork a repository see [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

2. Clone your fork of the Anno-Mage repo from your GitHub account to your local disk:

   ```bash
   $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/semi-auto-image-annotation-tool.git
   $ cd semi-auto-image-annotation-tool
   ```

3. Create a ``feature`` branch to hold your development changes:

   ```bash
   $ git checkout -b my-feature
   ```

   Always use a ``feature`` branch. It's good practice to never work on the ``master`` branch!

4. Develop the feature on your feature branch. Add changed files using ``git add`` and then ``git commit`` files:

   ```bash
   $ git add modified_files
   $ git commit
   ```

   to record your changes in Git, then push the changes to your GitHub account with:

   ```bash
   $ git push -u origin my-feature
   ```

5. Follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
to create a pull request from your fork. This will send an email to the committers.

(If any of the above seems like magic to you, please look up the
[Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/documentation) on the web, or ask a friend or another contributor for help.)

Pull Request Checklist
----------------------

We recommended that your contribution complies with the
following rules before you submit a pull request:

-  Follow the PEP8 coding convention.

-  Give your pull request a helpful title that summarises what your
   contribution does. In some cases `Fix <ISSUE TITLE>` is enough.
   `Fix #<ISSUE NUMBER>` is not enough.

-  Often pull requests resolve one or more other issues (or pull requests).
   If merging your pull request means that some other issues/PRs should
   be closed, you should
   [use keywords to create link to them](https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests/)
   (e.g., `Fixes #1234`; multiple issues/PRs are allowed as long as each one
   is preceded by a keyword). Upon merging, those issues/PRs will
   automatically be closed by GitHub. If your pull request is simply related
   to some other issues/PRs, create a link to them without using the keywords
   (e.g., `See also #1234`).

-  All public methods should have informative docstrings with sample
   usage presented as doctests when appropriate.

-  Please prefix the title of your pull request with `[MRG]` (Ready for
   Merge), if the contribution is complete and ready for a detailed review.
   Two core developers will review your code and change the prefix of the pull
   request to `[MRG + 1]` and `[MRG + 2]` on approval, making it eligible
   for merging. An incomplete contribution -- where you expect to do more work before
   receiving a full review -- should be prefixed `[WIP]` (to indicate a work
   in progress) and changed to `[MRG]` when it matures. WIPs may be useful
   to: indicate you are working on something to avoid duplicated work,
   request broad review of functionality or API, or seek collaborators.
   WIPs often benefit from the inclusion of a
   [task list](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments)
   in the PR description.

-  At least one paragraph of narrative documentation with links to
   references in the literature (with PDF links when possible) and
   the example.

You can also check for common programming errors with the following
tools:

-  No flake8 warnings, check with:

  ```bash
  $ pip install flake8
  $ flake8 path/to/repo
  ```

Documentation
-------------

We are glad to accept any sort of documentation: function docstrings,
reStructuredText documents (like this one), tutorials, etc.
reStructuredText documents live in the source code repository under the
doc/ directory.

You can edit the documentation using any text editor and then generate
the HTML output by typing ``make html`` from the doc/ directory.
Alternatively, ``make`` can be used to quickly generate the
documentation without the example gallery. The resulting HTML files will
be placed in ``_build/html/stable`` and are viewable in a web browser. See the
``README`` file in the ``doc/`` directory for more information.

For building the documentation, you will need
[sphinx](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/),
[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), and
[pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

When you are writing documentation, it is important to keep a good
compromise between mathematical and algorithmic details, and give
intuition to the reader on what the algorithm does. It is best to always
start with a small paragraph with a hand-waving explanation of what the
method does to the data and a figure (coming from an example)
illustrating it.
